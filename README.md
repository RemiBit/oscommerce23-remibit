OSCOMMERCE 2.3 REMIBIT MODULE

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

In order to install the module, it is necessary to access the server where the web files are hosted by ssh. If you donâ€™t know how to do that, please contact your site administrator or your hosting provider.

In this example we will use the default oscommerce configuration, so the website files are located in /var/www/html/oscommerce and they are owned by the default user www-data. Please replace [oscommerce] with the actual name (if different) of your website directory and [www-data] with the owner (if different) of your web files directory.

## Requirements

* A RemiBit merchant account
* oscommerce 2.3 (2.3.4.1 recommended)


## Installation

1/. Go to the oscommerce directory

```
cd /var/www/html/oscommerce
